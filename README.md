# The story of ðŸ’©

One day, I was asked to create a repo for a friend. As the request got to me before my first coffee did, I thought it would
suite the mood to make the new stomping grounds with the emoji name: ðŸ’©

Since emoji's are becoming more widely accepted as standard user input, I was just as entertaining to myself as curious to use
this for a repository name.

To my greatest surprise, GitHub allowed me to enter the emoji into the name field, and then went on to create the repo you're seeing now.

## But wait, there's more...

You might not be aware, but the `-` sign has special meaning in computing. It rarely registers as a normal alpha-numeric character
when used as a command input, so I was worried that it might break things. I still am, so the repo won't be used for anything.

I did however cloned it to see what happens when I try to add this readme.

After you clone the repo, you usually have to change to that directory. Being a big terminal mole myself, I issued the following
command:

```cd -```

Now if you don't know why that's hilarious, it's because that exact command means _"Change to the previous directory you were in"_

There I was chuckling baout how GitHub trolled me.

# What now?

I'm fairly certain GitHub is prepared to handle such things, and the don't have - for example - a directory for every repo with the repo name
and use bash to iterate through them. If so... I'm sorry.


As for the rest of us:
Always be vigilant about fallback data, and embrace the inevitable rise of the emojis.
